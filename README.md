# MovieMania
This project is a MovieMania  that allows users to manage a collection of movies by performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Users can view movie details, add new movies, update existing movie information, and delete movies from the collection. It includes features like pagination for navigating through the list of movies and persistent storage using the browser'sÂ localStorage.
